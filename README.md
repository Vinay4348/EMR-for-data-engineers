# EMR-for-data-engineers

## Description
### **Scalable Big Data Processing with Amazon EMR & Apache Spark**  

This project demonstrates a **production-grade ETL pipeline** using **Amazon EMR** and **Apache Spark** for large-scale data processing. It features:  

 **Optimized Spark ETL jobs** for efficient data transformation.  
 **Automated EMR provisioning** using AWS CLI/Terraform.  
 **Data Lake integration** with Amazon S3 for scalable storage.  
 **Security & Compliance** via IAM, encryption, and monitoring.  
 **Cost-efficient processing** with auto-scaling and performance tuning.

### **Spark ETL Script**

The **`spark-etl.py`** is a Python script that utilizes **Apache Spark** to perform **ETL operations**. It reads data from an input directory, processes it by adding a timestamp, and writes the result to an output directory in **Parquet** format.

#### **Usage**

To run the script, use the following command:
```
spark-submit spark-etl.py [s3-input-folder] [s3-output-folder]
```
- Replace `[s3-input-folder]` with the path to the input data directory.
- Replace `[s3-output-folder]` with the path where you want to save the processed output.

### **AWS Commands**

The **`commands.py`** directory contains detailed instructions and necessary scripts to set up and manage an AWS **EMR cluster**. This includes the following steps:
- Creating an **EMR cluster**.
- Configuring the required services and IAM roles.
- Submitting **Spark jobs** to the cluster.

---

### **Data**

The **`data/`** directory contains a sample dataset used for the ETL process. This dataset is representative of the type of data the Spark script is designed to process, allowing you to test and demonstrate the ETL pipeline.

---

### **Requirements**
- **Apache Spark**
- **AWS CLI**
- **An AWS account** with necessary permissions to create and manage EMR clusters.
